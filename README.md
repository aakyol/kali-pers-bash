# Kali Persistence Bash File

# What is this?
A bash file to make the usb-persistence process easier. Just run the script, it does the rest for you. And if it fails, you can run it again with just running this script again, without coping with writing terminal commands.

# How to use?
Just run the script file as bash ./kali-pers.sh from your terminal, enter the mount point for your parititon that you want to store the persisting files into. 

# More information
It allocates 7GB of space for persistence. 

# Why you wrote such a file?
Because, me and my friends spent some time failing while doing this, and I think it is a good idea to have an automated process for making persistence, especiall after when you try to do it manually by writing the commands, spending hours on it.

# Any problems? 
Feel free to inform, will fix it ASAP.
